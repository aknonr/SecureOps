# ADR-0020: In Use Local Review Workspace

Status: Accepted for the explicitly authorized In Use V1 local milestone.

Separate In Use discovery (active SMSS_oRFF category 4241/group 68) from the
existing SDM/Jira workflow. Reuse authenticated transport, exact-key parsing,
application capabilities, command tracking and transactional SQL audit.

Persist source snapshots separately from reviewed answers and local assignment.
Source changes invalidate drafts by source version. Every local mutation checks
the aggregate version. Retain absent records and all records on failed refresh;
bounded discovery never proves source closure. Corporate relationship response
keys remain unresolved until sanitized evidence establishes their exact shape.

Use the .NET ZIP/XML APIs for a minimal text-only XLSX without formulas, macros,
external links, Office automation or new dependencies. Retain legacy sheet and
column positions; blank legacy technical sheets remain blank. Add provenance
and explicitly unknown values rather than claim successful checks. Exports are
audited against a saved, current draft and exact record version.

InUse.View and InUse.Review grant only local workflow access; InUse.Assign and
InUse.Refresh are separate. Existing Admin receives these local capabilities;
explicit InUseReviewer and InUseCoordinator roles allow narrow approval. No
existing role acquires any additional external-write power. Scheduled refresh
is deferred to the planned Hangfire Worker after separate hosting approval.
